## RPi02W Tests

We'll now be using the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, powered by 4 AA batteries (in series) and a DC to DC buck-boost converter. We'll build the circuit and test everything just as we did in test 1.2, except with a different RPi model and power supply. This way, we'll know if the power supply is enough to run the project for the duration of the flight or not.
