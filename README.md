1. Cosmic ray detector (voted by Yajur and Maadhav as final)
2. Photo collection -> train AI?
3. Sent a plant/bacteria up and analyse health, temperature, pressure
4. Mirror to reflect sunlight in a place where it's dark already, and it looks light a faint UFO flashlight (This also seems very interesting)

## Cosmic Ray Detector

### Architecture

1. Scintillator + (Silicon?)Photomultiplier
2. SD Card for logging data
3. Case to withstand pressure
