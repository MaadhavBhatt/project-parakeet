# Project Parakeet

[@MaadhavBhatt](https://github.com/MaadhavBhatt) and [@yajurrsharma](https://github.com/yajurrsharma)'s Apex Project.

## Project Overview
We're sending a cosmic ray detector 30 km up into the sky (and making some music while we're at it).

## Project Goals

1. **Cosmic Ray Detection**: Design and build a high-altitude balloon payload capable of detecting cosmic rays at and under 30 km altitude.

2. **Data Collection**: Store this data locally.
   
3. **Sonification**: Convert cosmic ray detection data into musical notes.

4. **Educational Outreach**: Document our process and findings to inspire other students interested in atmospheric science, physics, and CS.

## Technical Components

- High-altitude weather balloon system (provided by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), [Apex](https://apex.hackclub.com/))
- Cosmic ray detector (scintillator)
- Raspberry Pi for data processing
- GPS tracking system
- Sound synthesis module
- SD card for data storage
- Durable payload container with thermal insulation
- Power supply (batteries)
