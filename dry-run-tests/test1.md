## Test 1 (RPi 4)

### Idea

One end of a jumper wire is attached to GPIO **_17_** of the RPIi 4. The other end is then touched to the 3.3V pin, essentially 
simulating an energy spike. This simulates a ray being hit. Test results to be posted soon, along with other advancements.

### Results

Soon.
