## Test 1.1 (Raw Code)

### Idea

We'll be writing a code to simulate a cosmic ray, and then time for how long the dummy GPIO pin stays HIGH for, to deduce energy. The interesting bit of this will be that there will be 2 
seperate programs, one to **_create_** a ray of a random energy level, and one to **_deduce_** energy by the time period.

### Results

Soon.
